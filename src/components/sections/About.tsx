These goals primarily revolve around learning new things - every day, I strive to discover something new, enhance my programming skills, and acquire new knowledge about technologies. Usually, I start my day with a good cup of coffee and reading articles, watching videos on technology, and generally staying updated on the world of IT.

                    However, technology is not the only important aspect. I also dedicate a lot of time to personal development, reading books (mostly about psychology), and engaging in physical exercises."
